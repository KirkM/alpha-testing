The daily builds PPA provides unstable packages:

- The features in this packages are not expected to be complete.
- The translations in these packages are not expected to be present.
- We recommend you use timeshift to have regular snapshots, so that you can go back in time if something breaks.

Alpha testing is only about regressions.

If something is working in the current stable release of Linux Mint but broken in the PPA, please report it here.

Do not create issues for:
